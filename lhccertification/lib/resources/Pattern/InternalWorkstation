## Pattern for "internal workstations".
## InternalWorkstation is a relaxed variant of the "PublicServer" pattern:

## The pattern consists of
##  (2) requirements that must be satisfied, 
##      in the form of references to authority documents;
##  (1) exceptions, i.e., requirements that need not be satisfied.
##    (a) requirements to waive altogether
##    (b) scriptlets to skip

## The exceptions must precede the requirements.


# Per LHC/3.3.1:
waive CIS/3.4
waive CIS5/4.4
waive HHS/CM-7,5
waive HHS/CM-7,6
waive LHC/1.25

# Per LHC/3.3.2:
waive CIS/3.5
waive CIS5/4.5

# Per LHC/3.3.3:
skip services-off-smb

# Per LHC/3.3.4:
skip services-off-nfs

# Per LHC/3.3.5:
skip services-off-nfslock
skip services-off-autofs

# Per LHC/3.3.6:
skip services-off-ypbind

# Allow compilers:
waive CIS5/SN.10
waive LHC/1.48

# Allow removable filesystems
waive CIS5/7.3

# Allow USB devices
### Note: The requirement is also waived, for maybe different reasons,
### for public servers. If the requirement were to be enforced for
### internal workstations, must replace the "waive" with an explicit
### preemptory "require" statement!
waive CIS5/7.9

# Allow rw NFS exports
waive LHC/1.21

# Allow NIS on internal workstations:
waive Local/1

# Allow printing:
skip services-off-cups

# Allow core dumps (because they not a matter of security)
waive HHS/CM-7,2
waive CIS5/9.10

# Require Azeti nagios agent (if the computer is in "the computer room")
#waive Local/7

# PIV reader software currently NOT deployed on any Linux machines - waive check Local/6 (scriptlets/pivcardreader)
# PublicServer also waives this check
waive Local/6

#
# Now the requirements:
#
include PublicServer
