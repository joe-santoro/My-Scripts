## Pattern for "public servers".

## The pattern consists of
##  (2) requirements that must be satisfied, 
##      in the form of references to authority documents;
##  (1) exceptions, i.e., requirements that need not be satisfied.
##    (a) requirements to waive altogether
##    (b) scriptlets to skip

## The exceptions must precede the requirements.
