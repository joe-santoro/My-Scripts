Scripts may write to stdout and/or stderr, it makes no difference.

Common "if" condition idioms:

A file exists and does not contain a pattern.
  [ "`grep -c ^+: /etc/group`" = "0" ]

Two files are equal.
  diff -b  FILE_A  FILE_B

A service is turned on via launchd/launchctl:
    if launchctl list com.apple.sysmond &> /dev/null 


User home directories:
  awk -F: '($3 >= 500) && ($7 !~ /nologin/) { print $6 }' /etc/passwd
  (The user number suffices for everyone except nfsnobody and csvn.)


Check existence, owner, group, mode:
    find /usr/lib/cron/tabs/root -maxdepth 1 \
        \( \! -perm 400 -o \! -user root -o \! -group wheel \) -ls

Check that grep finds at least one matching line:
    grep_positive '@lhcsyslog.nlm.nih.gov' /etc/syslog.conf

    --user_home_perm=*)
        user_home_perm=`expr "$1" : '[^=]*=\(.*\)'`
        shift
        ;;
